# Basic_System_Modeling
# The purpose of this project is too see how well I can model systems using a Keras Sequental neural net, despite the outputs representing a portion of the system's inputs at a future time step.
# The following modules are required to run this projects notebook files:
# NumPy
# Pandas
# Matplotlib
# Tensorflow
# Keras
